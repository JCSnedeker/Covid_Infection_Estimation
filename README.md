## Using a simplified approach to estimate Covid-19 cases by state
### This analysis uses corrections of asymptomatic cases and testing limitations to estimate real case loads

One of the most important features to characterize about the progression of the Covid-19 pandemic is the real number of cases. Knowing, or at lease approximating, the real caseload of previous Covid cases in each state will help lawmakers understand how close a state is to herd immunity, what the probability is of another Covid-19 outbreak in the area, and what sorts of restrictions may need to be taken to limit another wave of the disease locally. Crucially, knowing the number of people who have had the virus would allow lawmakers to estimate the fractional reduction in contact (an thus the number of restrictions that could be imposed) that would result in pseudo-herd immunity. For the purpose of this discussion pseudo-herd immunity is the number of previous poitive cases in a population where a certain set of restrictions would effectively limit contacts between carriers and uninfected people such that it is impossible for the virus to spread after a new case is introduced. This number is hard to ascertain directly for a number of reasons. First, a large portion of Covid-19 cases are asymptomatic and without widespread screening of the population for the disease, these cases are unlikely to be counted. Additionally, while testing has increased throughout the pandemic, both at the start of the pandemic as well as during major local outbreaks, testing has lagged behind what would be required to get a guage of the real number of Covid cases. 
Multiple efforts have been undertaken to try to estimate the Covid caseload. Among these efforrs, [Wu et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18272-4) used a Bayesian model to retroactively predict prior cases in each state. Their findings that caseloads are dramtically underestimated across the country is consistent with [antibody testing](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/04/30/2020.04.14.20062463.full.pdf) that also found that Covid-19 was far more widespread than reported by confirmed cases. Accordingly, the CDC estimates that the real case counts are [6 to 24 times higher](https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/21/cdc-study-actual-covid-19-cases/) across the country than officially reported. This has resulted in some public health experts are estimating that the US may reach [herd immunity](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/12/15/946714505/fauci-predicts-u-s-could-see-signs-of-herd-immunity-by-late-march-or-early-april) by the Spring of 2021 independent of vaccination efforts. To test these models and make policy decisions in the meantime, though, it is important to have simple ongoing estimations of Covid-19 cases by an easy to use algorithm that relies only easily available Covid-19 numbers and is easily applied. The data used to define such an algorithm was obtained from the [Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) for up to date Covid-19 data and from the [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/topics/population.html) for population data. These data are included in the repository as all.states.history for the Covid data and as nst-est2019-01.csv for the population statistics.
To generate an initial idea of the effect of testing limitations, I first plotted the calculated percent of the population with a confirmed positive result against the positive testing rate for each state. Each state varies considerabley with the Dakotas reporting approximately 12% of the population having confirmed cases with a ~35% positive test rate to Hawaii and Maine which have just approximately 1% of the population with confirmed Covid-19 cases with a ~2% positive test rate. Generally, the curve shows that there is only a limited increase in the positive rate and confirmed cases while both the cases and positive rate are low (under 10), but when the positive rate is high (above 10), the positive rate can grow rapidly independent of increasing case counts. This is likely due to cases greatly exceeding testing capacity during the worst outbreaks. Thus, high positive rates are a key factor to be corrected for in estimating case loads for each state.
